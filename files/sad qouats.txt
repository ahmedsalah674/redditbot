We must understand that sadness is an ocean, and sometimes we drown, while other days we are forced to swim
There are moments when I wish I could roll back the clock and take all the sadness away, but I have the feeling that if I did, the joy would be gone as well
Sadness flies away on the wings of time.
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
